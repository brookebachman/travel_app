This is an application where a user can plan their vacation. They can see the weather for their upcoming trip!

A user can enter a city name and find out the weather for their upcoming trip.

In order to get this project to work you need to sign up for API keys from Geonames.com, Weatherbit.com and Pixabay.com.

You can store your api keys in your .env file
{
API_KEY_GEONAMES= <YOUR-API-KEY>

PIXABAY_API_KEY= <YOUR-API-KEY>

API_KEY_WEATHERBIT=<YOUR-API-KEY>
}

The extra Feature that I implemented was the length of the trip!
